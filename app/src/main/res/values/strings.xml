    <string name="rules">The basic premise of the game is this:
        \n\nyou roll six dice. Some combinations of dice will
        \n\nscore points, while others don’t. You take out the
        \n\ndice that have scored points and then decide whether to
        \n\nkeep that score, or re-roll the remaining dice to try to
        \n\nscore more points. But if you roll again and don’t score
        \n\npoints, you lose what you’ve earned so far. So the game
        \n\nmoves quickly and there’s an element of risk that makes
        \n\nit really fun to play.</string>
